### MUSIC PLAYER FUNCTIONALITY BELOW
###
### Used this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZlvRr9KxM)
### to get minimum functionality, then built on this to create 
### a much more useful set of commands.
###
### PURPOSE:
###
### Since Rythm bot and others received cease and desists from 
### Youtube, we've no longer had a need to use this bot for its
### original intended purpose, which was to organize playlists
### of songs (using Youtube playlists) so that we can listen to
### music together.
###
### So, I've now written similar functionalities into this bot,
### giving users (my friends and I) a way to still listen to music
### together while building our own playlists from Discord, which
### has been super easy. Since this is a low profile bot, I don't 
### expect Youtube to send me a cease and desist (lol), so it'll
### hopefully work long enough for us to enjoy. Here's to hoping
### that Discord doesn't totally deprecate audio-playing in the 
### near future :)

  #   1. are subject to change throughout the object (the song queue)
  #   2. don't change but are useful for every function (bot, youtube downloader) 
  #       and additions to the bot in the future
  #
  # Past classes in this bot used global variables which was bad practice

  ### Helper class(es)





  ##
  # Yt_song (Youtube Song) object
  # 
  # Stores data about a youtube video.
  # 
  # Goal is to improve readability, writability, and permanence
  # of the code below (permanence = e.g. not having a list of these
  # vars w/ hardcoded instances that would need to change in the future).

  ### Beginning of callable commands





  ##
  # Connect command
  # 
  # Dependencies:
  #   - needed to `pip install PyNaCl` to be able to connect to voice channels
  # 
  # Bot guaranteed to connect to user's channel, unless major issue
  # 
  # Bot joins vc if not connected, moves to user if in different 
  # channel, otherwise does nothing since already in user's channel
  ##

  ##
  # Play command
  # 
  # Functionalities:
  #   - joins user's channel if not in it and start playing music
  #   - plays requested song regardless of queue, does not clear queue
  #   - auto-plays next song in queue if queue isn't empty
  # 
  # Dependencies: 
  #   - had to `brew install ffmpeg` to get the ffmpeg exectuable, whose path we see below. 
  #       manual static download didn't work, was like 74MB and the ffmpeg exe we want is like 400KB
  #   - had to `pip install PyNaCl` for bot to be able to join voice channel
